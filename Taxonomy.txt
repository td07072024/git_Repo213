The genus name Aegypius is a Greek word (αἰγυπιός) for 'vulture', or a bird not unlike one; Aelian describes the aegypius as "halfway between a vulture (gyps) and an eagle". Some authorities think this a good description of a lammergeier; others do not.[who?] Aegypius is the eponym of the species, whatever it was in ancient Greek.[3] The English name 'black vulture' refers to the plumage colour, while the specific name monachus (monk) and 'monk vulture', a direct translation of its German name Mönchsgeier, refers to the bald head and ruff of neck feathers like a monk's cowl. The name 'Cinereous vulture' (Latin cineraceus, ash-coloured; pale, whitish grey), was a deliberate attempt to rename it with a new name distinct from the American black vulture,[4] but has also been used historically by Francis Willughby for the pale grey juvenile of the largely white Egyptian vulture.[5]

It is most closely related to the lappet-faced vulture, with this pair then to the white-headed vulture and the red-headed vulture;[6] all three have sometimes been included with it in a broader interpretation of the genus Aegypius.[7]

This bird is an Old World vulture, and as such is only distantly related to the New World vultures, which are in a separate family, Cathartidae, of the same order. It is, therefore, not closely related to the much smaller American black vulture (Coragyps atratus) despite the similar name and colour.
